## Implementation
* Python >= 3.5
* Tensorflow >= 2.1.0
* Window 10 or Linux
* Follow the "FLAGS" in the Gender_age_model_3_ver3.py

## Result
* Morph and AFAD (Age)

* Samples of training graphs (GRA-GAN, average the loss per step, it's not implemented in this code (if you want to make this graphs then you should add the average loss code).)
